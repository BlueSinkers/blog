She is a professor at UMD specializing in Domain-Specific Architecture for Deep Learning and Sparse System Solving. Sparse systems are prevalent in many fields of study, including machine learning. One particular example I aim to solve and work with in this project is Collaborative Filtering. This tool is commonly used by video-streaming services like YouTube and Netflix. It works by analyzing user preferences and behaviors to suggest items that similar users have enjoyed. It helps personalize content by leveraging patterns in user data to make relevant suggestions.\r\n\r\n# Project Completion\r\n\r\nThis project hasn’t been completed yet simply because I’ve not found time since December of last year to continue working on it. Fortunately, a significant chunk of the project has been completed so far and I have plans to complete the rest of it over Winter Break prior to the start of 2025\\. \r\n\r\n# More Information\r\n\r\nTo learn more about sparse systems, check out Dr. Asgari’s Website for the [Computer Architecture and Systems Lab](https://casl.cs.umd.edu/), and other online resources online including the various textbooks published by many esteemed authors in the field.\r\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"67d3bd83-0f8d-526a-8ff9-4924c0dd4e6c","frontmatter__slug":"sparsity","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"sparsity"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Sparsity","dateMade":"08-07-2024","dateEdited":"08-07-2024","slug":"sparsity","syn":"PROJECT: this is my blog write-up of Sparsity","tags":["project","tech"],"image":"https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.8316e8c7d8e85a90180e3c2a11feb99a?rik=F9ht5JGzOOiLnw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bitrebels.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2018%2f06%2fprogramming-languages-learn-header-image.jpg&ehk=9Q7qLlBXLrgix6BD8%2buPjSX9%2baHpahyJ0dvHnC%2fGmP8%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"],"slicesMap":{}}
